 Creating autonomous systems that can navigate and interact with their environment has  been a long-standing pursuit in the field of robotics.
 The goal of creating autonomous systems that can navigate and interact with their environment has
 been a long-standing pursuit in the field of robotics. This report focuses on the design and
 development of one such system- a robotic platform equipped with sensors for obstacle avoidance
 and decision-making capabilities.
 The primary objective of this project is to engineer a robotic system that can autonomously move
 through various environments while intelligently avoiding obstacles. This is achieved through the
 integration of mechanical, electrical, and software components to achieve seamless functionality.
 An essential part of a robotic system is mechatronics, a combination of mechanical engineering,
 electronic engineering, and computer science. Propulsion is provided by DC motors, environmental
 perception is provided by sensors, and decision-making is done by microcontrollers. Essentially, it
 emulates some of the rudimentary features of autonomous systems
